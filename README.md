This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What it is

a Next JS project that contains a search bar and Character cards. While playing the game "Stardew Valley", making friends is about giving gifts. It may be hard to remember who likes what unless you write it down or keep the wiki open. I created a simple search function that contains the loves, likes, neutrals, dislikes, and hates of each of the Marriage candidates.

## Why did I create this?

My wife and I don't play too often so we tend to forget who likes what when we get back in our farm.

On the technical side, I wanted to learn react without making a to-do list while that would've worked fine. By creating this simple app I have motivation to keep updating it with more characters, and more functionality because it serves us a purpose (and anyone who finds it useful).

## What I learned with this project

Learned how useful creating a web app or website with React can be. Next JS pushed me to also learn tailwind CSS and the simple concepts of TypeScript. I realized React isn't so scary as it seemed at first when I tried to learn it in the beggining of the year.

tldr; Learned:
- React JS components
- Tailwind CSS
- some TypeScript
- React Hooks
